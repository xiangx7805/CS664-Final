# Maze Solving :paw_prints:
#### MET CS664 Final Project
*Xu, Xiang*

## Project description
- Design a prgram that can solve a 30x30 maze.   
- It has an entrance, and an exit, which are always on the outside wall. Any square can be open or wall.  
- You must show this on 2 separate mazes and the complete path that was taken to exit the maze.  
- You need to solve by 2 separate algorithms, and one must be A*.  
- Try for an optimal solution, but solving is priority.
